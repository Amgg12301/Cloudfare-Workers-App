# Cloudflare Workers Internship Application: Full-Stack

I worked with the Cloudfare Workers and Fetch APIs to create a JavaScript web application that distributes requests between variants from a URL. Inside the event's script handler, I used the Fetch API to make requests and distribute them amongst the two variants using A/B testing, such that the each variant would appear ~50% of the time. You can visit this web application at https://amogh-cloudfare-workers.amoghgiri01.workers.dev/.
